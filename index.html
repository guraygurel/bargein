    <p>This electronjs package provides security bypasses for testing purposes. Not to be used to connect to real sites. Intended for design environments only.</p>
    <p>If you choose to proceed,
      <ul>
        <li>This program will look for the file: <span id="bargeinerrorcode">default text</span>. Do not proceed unless you trust the contents of this file.</li>
        <li>The program may create links according to the content of this file</li>
        <li>It may run external scripts on the next page or any of the links you choose to follow</li>
        <li>It will not show warnings about security certificates. This means that your connection to any of the linked pages may not be private</li>
        <li>External scripts may perform actions on your behalf such as filling form fields, clicking a button or logging in.</li>
        <li>Any information you submit or receive through this program may be compromised.</li>
